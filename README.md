This is a personal project I created to practice flex-box and other CSS properties.  It is mostly finished but I may come back to it from time to time to tweak various things.  This was originally going to be used as my tribute page for the freeCodeCamp CSS certificate, but some of the required test items didn't line up with how I styled the site.

I'm happy with how the site turned out, and it was a fun challenge getting everything to work.  The main challenge I had was getting certain flex-box properties to work.  The issue ended up being a couple missing "<" on </li> tags.  Once that was fixed everything worked how I wanted it to.
